## Define Overpass

> An overpass is a road, bridge, or pedestrian crossing that is constructed over another road, railway, or waterway. It is designed to allow traffic to flow over the obstacle without any interruption. Overpasses are typically constructed with multiple lanes and are used to relieve congestion on busy roads. They are usually made of concrete or steel and can be either elevated or at ground level.
